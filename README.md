# Braintree Visualization

This is a [gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/) app to visualize Braintree transactions. It queries the Braintree Advanced Search API.

This project is still in the early stages.

## Future

* Configurable API keys (configure in UI?)
* Switch from squares to something more appealing (circles?)
 * Maybe use transparency so objects can overlay
* Color by transaction status
* Package as a standalone app
